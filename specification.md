UofT Campus Location Review System:

Running the project brings up an alphanumerically gridded map of the UofT campus with a prompt for the user to enter where they are based on the alphanumeric grid. Each location corresponds to a coordinate on the map of the UofT campus, floor, basic functions, traffic, capacity, custom?, distance, and atmosphere. Users can select filters based on above attributes to narrow their search. Locations will be recommended based on distance from user after user inputs their location. 

When reviewers leave a review for a location they must specify a recommendation (stars) and may also leave a comment. All users of the system log in with their username. Users can choose to be contacted by email.
