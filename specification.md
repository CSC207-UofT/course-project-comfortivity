UofT Campus Location Review System:

Specification:

ii.	Running the program creates a shell that prompts the user to input his location

iii.	The user inputs his location based on the alphanumerically gridded map.

iv.	Each building has attributes like: private study space, group study space, bathrooms, water fountain, food, accessibility, grid location

v.	The user can choose which attributes they do and donâ€™t want from the specific buildings. These would be implemented as filters in the search.

vi.	The  program will return locations with those attributes that best fit the users specifications

vii.	The user can leave a review of a building in stars.
