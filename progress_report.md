Progress Report:
Our Code is meant to be a productivity app that aids everyday students, especially the relatively new ones, make better planned decisions on where to spend their time in between classes.

So far, we have been able to plan the structure of the code, although we do not yet know exactly how certain parts will be implemented, we have a good idea of what each part should do.

Data Management:
We have decided to use an external database, but we are not yet sure if we should use a regular txt file that we will write onto, or use an actual database.

Challenges:
Our two greatest challenges are planned meetings and git hub.
GitHub: Git hub was a big problem from the onset, from creating. Even after we were able to clone repository, when it came to pushing and merging files and branches, we came upon various problems. Some files werenâ€™t registered as Java files, and when we re-cloned the repository, our project files were under a different folder called project files preventing some of us from running the files.
Planned Meetings: We have only been able to meet once in person, and only 3/5 members were present. We are also a small group, so each person is crucial to the success of the group.

Moving Forward:
We plan on fleshing out our code more. Start with actually implementing algorithms for our more advanced methods, like the search method. We will decide on how we will implement our database.

As a team, we will all commit to 2 hour weekly meetings.
